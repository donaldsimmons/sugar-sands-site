        <h3>Contracts and Agreements</h3>
        <p>All contracts and agreements signed during the booking process are binding and final.
            Any changes to these documents after approval by both parties (through the signatures
            of both parties) must be approved by SSBW prior to adoption. All changes made after
            approval will constitute a new and separate agreement, and may entail adjustment
            in charges or other requirements before the wedding planning process can move forward.</p>
        <p>Sugar Sands Beach Weddings reserves the right to allow or deny any requests for changes
            or alterations in services, at any time. This decision will be made by SSBW alone, and
            will be reflected by the company's schedule and other concerns.</p>

        <h3>Scheduling</h3>
        <p>Due to the nature of our business, we cannot be held responsible for any disturbances
            to scheduled events resulting from inclement weather or other mitigating factors.
            In addition, we conduct our weddings on public beaches, and cannot be held responsible
            for any delays or inconveniences resulting from overcrowding or encroaching members
            of the public. While we strive to negate all of these factors, any interference in
            the form of noise or proximity to others is beyond our control, and is simply a risk
            taken by the individual when booking a beach wedding.</p>
        <p>If delays are necessary and unavoidable, we will attempt to reschedule or reconvene the
            ceremony at a later date or in a different location; however, we reserve the right to
            make this decision at our discretion, and, except in extreme circumstances also determined
            at our discretion, no refund, discount, or any other monetary or service-based recompense
            will be provided.</p>
