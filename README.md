Sugar Sands Beach Weddings Website
================

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This repository contains the files and site structure for the Sugar Sands Beach Weddings website. It was designed and constructed as the final project required for the completion of my Bachelor's Degree program, and is based on the services of a fictional business and their services. The files are complete, and are the exact files that form the live site at <strong>www.sugarsandsweddings.com</strong>.</p>

<h2>Code Development</h2>

<p>SSBW's site was constructed using <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong> for its main functionality, and employs the <strong>CodeIgniter</strong> framework from EllisLab, Inc. The site makes use of the MVC architecture to separate functionality, information, and display, and includes CRUD functionality for manipulating data through the customer and administrator portals on the site.</p>

<p>In the site's view files, simple <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> are used to create the UI. Where necessary, the more advanced features of <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong> were used; these features are specifically seen in the forms and inputs on the site, as well as in the use of CSS3 features like linear gradients.</p>

<p>Light <strong>JavaScript</strong> functions were used for various aspects of the site, and the <strong>jQuery</strong> library was used whenever possible. This scripting can be seen on such site features as the drop down menus in the navigation scheme, the main slideshow on the site's home page, and on the image galleries found throughout the site.</p>

<h2>Access Instructions</h2>

<p>Since the site does include restricted-access features that are accessible only by registered users, login information is needed to view portions of the site. There are separate portals for regular users and administrator, and both types of portals include functionality specific to that user's needs. However, new user accounts can only be created by an administrator, so the following login information can be used to access these portions of the site.</p>

<h4>Admin Information</h4>

<p><strong>Username</strong>: admin <br>
<strong>Password</strong>: admin</p>

<h4>Customer Information</h4>

<p><strong>Username</strong>: suestorm <br>
<strong>Password</strong>: invisible</p>

<p>Feel free to explore the site using this information, and to create and update a new account to experience the full scope of the site's functionality. <strong>However, please do not update or delete already existing accounts/users</strong>: This will allow us to maintain the integrity of the site for other users.</p>
